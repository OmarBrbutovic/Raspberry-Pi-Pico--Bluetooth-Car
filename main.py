# This code controls a car using UART communication and an ultrasonic sensor.
# The car can move forward, backward, turn left, turn right, and stop based on commands received via the UART channel over Bluetooth.
# The car has a crash prevention feature that uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in front of the robot.
# If the crash prevention feature is enabled and the car is about to collide with an obstacle, the robot will stop.
# The car has a function to measure the distance to an obstacle using the ultrasonic sensor.
